## Welcome to TPT

This project contains a collection of simple and easy to use C programs written during my programming journey.
These programs contain examples demonstrating datastructures, algorithms, network programming, linux system calls, linux IPC and various other concepts related to computer science.

### Help

If you happen to find any bugs in the programs or better/optimized ways of expressing the examples in the programs, please feel free to contribute.
